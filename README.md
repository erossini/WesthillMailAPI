.NET API samples for Westhill Mail
=========

This repository contains sample projects .NET 4 showing how to do some common tasks with the Westhill Mail API APIs.
Westhill Mail API has two flavours of API, which both can perform the same functions. There is an API that uses SOAP, and an API that is RESTful. Either one or even both can be used, depending on which technology is preferable. 
Please be aware that the Westhill Mail API has usage limits – please use bulk API methods where possible, and use the in-app API call debugger if needed to troubleshoot integration.

Pull requests are encouraged. Please contribute any updates or bug fixes.

To open the app:
1. In the Finder, locate the required app. Don’t use Launchpad to do this as Launchpad doesn’t allow access to the shortcut menu.
2. Press the Control key and then click the app icon.
3. Choose Open from the shortcut menu.
4. Click Open. The app is saved as an exception to security settings, and it will be possible to open it in the future by double-clicking it, just like any registered app.
